In order to renovate my room I would start off with preparing the room for a renovation:
Clear anything that doesn't belong there.
Remove all small personal belongings. (Books, devices, tools, etc.)
Remove all furniture.
Remove any wall decorations that can be removed.
Vacuum the floor.
Lay out protective covers and tape around anything that cannot be removed.

Then I would complete the actual renovation:
Painting the walls
While the paint dries:
	Determining which items I would like to keep and which I do not need nor want (both furniture and personal belongings).
	Prepare unwanted items for donation, stash them away to sell at a later point or throw them away depending on their condition.
	Prepare a new furniture arrangement.

After the paint has dried:
Remove the protective covers and tape.
Move furniture items back inside.
Put personal belongings back in their correct place.
If I have any decorative wall hangings:
	Decorate the walls, being mindful of furniture placement.

This about finishes it.
